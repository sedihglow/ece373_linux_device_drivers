A. Information Gathering

1. A. List the BUGS when using the system call
	- it is not possible to enable signal-driven I/O by specifying O_ASYNC.
	  use fcntl() to enable the flag.
	- Must check for two different error codes, EISDIR and ENOENT, when trying
	  to determine whether the kernel supports O_TMPFILE.
	- When both O_CREAT and O_DIRECTORY are specified in flags and the file 
	  specified by pathname does not exist, open() will create a regular file
	  ignoreing O_DIRECTORY.

   B. What files needto be included to use this function?
	- sys/types.h
	- sys/stat.h
	- fcntl.h
   
   C. List the first three related system calls to open()
    - chmod()
	- chown()
	- close()

   D. Choose one of the system calls and list its bugs and files which need to
	  be included.
	- chmod() bugs
		- no bugs section in this man page.
	- chmod() headers
		- sys/stat.h

2. A. usb_device
	- int devnum
	- char devpath[16]
	- u32 route
	- enum usb_device_state state
	- enum usb_device_speed speed

   B. fifth members header declaration is in ch9.h line 1159-1166
      Kernel version 5.17.1

   C. enum usb_device_speed {
	          USB_SPEED_UNKNOWN = 0, /* enumerating */
			  USB_SPEED_LOW, USB_SPEED_FULL, /* usb 1.1 */
	          USB_SPEED_HIGH, /* usb 2.0 */
	          USB_SPEED_WIRELESS, /* wireless (usb 2.5) */
	          USB_SPEED_SUPER, /* usb 3.0 */
	          USB_SPEED_SUPER_PLUS, /* usb 3.1 */
	  }
