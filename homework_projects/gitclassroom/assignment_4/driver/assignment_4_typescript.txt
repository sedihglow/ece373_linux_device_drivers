---intel 82540EM pci driver module testing---This program is to run tests on the intel_82540EM kernel module.
Read will read the blink_rate param and return its value.
Write will write to blink_rate param to blink at new value.

Please choose which test to run.
1. read blink_rate param: value of blink rate via read().
2. WR to ctrl leds: writes new blink rate then reads it back.
3. exit
