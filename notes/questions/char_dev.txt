for the major and minor numbers, we pass the first minor and count to the alloc
function.

How do we know what count to use for the minor number? What exactly is the minor
number and how do we know what the count should be for our driver?


file operations

int (*release) (struct inode *, struct file *);

what is release? cant find a man page on it.
- release is just close() in user space. double check theres not a function ptr
  for close() in file operations struct.
