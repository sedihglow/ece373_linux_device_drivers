dmesg
dmesg -T (time stamp stuff with dmessage)
dmseg -T | tail -10
dmesg | tail -10 | cat > outfile.txt

dmesg -w (w stands for wait for new messages --follow) 
same behavior as tail -f

dmesg -C clear dmesg buffer

tail -f syslog opens file and whenever something happens it will spool to the
output.
